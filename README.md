# 🧾 Java Student Record Management System

Welcome to my **Java CLI-based Student Record Management System**, created as part of my internship at **Elevate Labs**.  
This project allows users to manage student data through a menu-driven console interface with full CRUD functionality.

---

## 📌 Description

This is a **console-based CRUD application** built using **Java**.  
It manages student records using an **ArrayList** to store objects of a `Student` class.  
The app provides a menu for the user to **Add**, **View**, **Update**, and **Delete** records.  

The project was developed using **IntelliJ IDEA** for writing and testing code.
